# ML
This is my Machine Learning repo

This repository will contain implementation of well known Machine Learning algorithms.

### Classifiers
##### Decision Trees: 
  * ID3: The "text-book" implementation of the ID3 algorithm (may be used only with discrete values).
         At each step the algorithm chooses the best attribute based on the value of a "purity function" (Entropy, Information Gain, Gini Index, etc.)
  * ExtendedID3: Extension of the ID3 algorithm that can handle continuous valued attributes.
